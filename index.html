    <p id="para"><b>Psychologists </b>believe that the relationship between human and canine is a 
bidirectional attachment bond, which resembles that of the typical human caretaker/infant 
relationship, and shows all of the usual hallmarks of a typical bond. Some examples of
 behaviors that led scientists to this conclusion is the display of proximity seeking
  behavior where the canine will seek out its caretaker as a means to cope with stress, 
  and consequently the absence of the caretaker will trigger separation anxiety to a varying 
  degree. Another such behavior is the safe haven effect, which describes when the canine
   more freely explores novel objects in the caretaker's presence. Canines are capable
    of assessing humans' emotional states, as well as discriminating humans by levels of 
    familiarity.</p>
